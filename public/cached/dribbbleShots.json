    "description": "<p>I think it's been a while since I had last designed my resume, the print version. It was around 2 years ago, and I was a completely different person back then. I've heard the saying, a resume is like a reflection of oneself, so if I'm bound to change, so should that nifty little document.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, here's my latest resume, and like most apps on the interwebs, even it has caught the dark mode fever. I'm also finally moving away from the one-page resume to a three-page CV, with the cover letter. This may be a sign of growth? No idea, but it looks heavy!</p>\n\n<p>Some things I focused on while making the resume, 1) make sure it can be parsed, 2) make sure it is easy to edit once you have a new field and 3) make sure looks GOOD! (and you can be the judge of that)</p>\n\n<p>It was designed entirely from scratch in Figma, and I will be making the files open source so you can use the template to design your own resume, or even mix-match colors as well. Drop me your email address if interested and I'll share the file with you.</p>\n\n<p>You can browse through the entire resume here:\n<br />http://pillai.xyz/resume-pdf</p>\n\n<p>Please feel free to leave any comments ;) I'm posting on dev.to so I can get some constructive criticism from people who have taken a lot of interviews already.</p>\n\n<p>I'm currently scouting for a job in Berlin, Germany (looking to relocate), hence the new redesign and weekend exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all so much!</p>",
